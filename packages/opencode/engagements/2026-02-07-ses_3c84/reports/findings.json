Performed safe localhost reconnaissance: nmap scan of common ports (22,80,443,3000,8080,8443,3389,5900) showed no open ports on 127.0.0.1. Loopback interface confirmed active (lo0: inet 127.0.0.1). No listening services detected on standard ports. This confirms: (1) The finding tool successfully appends to finding.md, (2) Network scanning tools (nmap) are functional, (3) The sub-agent environment is operational.",
