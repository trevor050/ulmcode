Use this tool when you have completed the planning phase and are ready to exit plan agent.

This tool switches from plan agent to the prior execution agent so implementation can begin.

Call this tool:
- After you have written a complete plan to the plan file
- After you have clarified any questions with the user
- After the user has explicitly confirmed in chat that the plan is approved
- When you are confident the plan is ready for implementation

Do NOT call this tool:
- Before you have created or finalized the plan
- If you still have unanswered questions about the implementation
- If the user has indicated they want to continue planning or requested plan changes
