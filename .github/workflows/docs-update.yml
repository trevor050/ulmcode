            Review the following commits from the last 4 hours and identify any new features that may need documentation.

            <recent_commits>
            ${{ steps.commits.outputs.list }}
            </recent_commits>

            Steps:
            1. For each commit that looks like a new feature or significant change:
               - Read the changed files to understand what was added
               - Check if the feature is already documented in packages/web/src/content/docs/*
            2. If you find undocumented features:
               - Update the relevant documentation files in packages/web/src/content/docs/*
               - Follow the existing documentation style and structure
               - Make sure to document the feature clearly with examples where appropriate
            3. If all new features are already documented, report that no updates are needed
            4. If you are creating a new documentation file be sure to update packages/web/astro.config.mjs too.

            Focus on user-facing features and API changes. Skip internal refactors, bug fixes, and test updates unless they affect user-facing behavior.
            All doc related commits should start with "docs:" prefix.
