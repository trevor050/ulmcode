# K-12 Incident Response

## Objective
Move quickly without losing evidence quality or reporting discipline.

## Workflow
1. classify incident severity and immediate containment needs.
2. collect immutable evidence and preserve chain-of-custody metadata.
3. build a normalized timeline from multi-source artifacts.
4. identify affected systems/accounts and probable entry path.
5. publish actionable containment and recovery next actions.

## Guardrails
- default to non-destructive evidence collection.
- record unknowns explicitly during live response.
- keep operator actions time-stamped for post-incident review.

## Required Artifacts
- incident timeline output.
- affected asset/account inventory.
- containment + recovery checklist with owners.
