# K-12 Identity And Privilege Escalation

## Purpose
Assess whether identity and privilege boundaries actually protect district-critical systems.

## Covers
- Active Directory attack paths and abuse chains
- Windows and Linux privilege escalation workflows
- Controlled exploitation using approved tooling
- Prioritization of escalation paths by blast radius and student-data impact

## Workflow
1. Confirm authorization and boundaries for escalation testing.
2. Enumerate identity trust paths and privilege boundaries.
3. Validate escalation opportunities with minimum-impact proofs.
4. Record practical attack path from initial foothold to high-value assets.
5. Provide immediate containment recommendations per path.

## Constraints
- No persistence or uncontrolled spread outside approved plan.
- Maintain strict rollback and stop criteria for high-impact exploit steps.
