# K-12 Identity And Privilege Escalation

## Objective
Determine whether identity and privilege controls actually prevent compromise of high-value district assets.

## Mission Boundaries
- stay inside explicit authorization and approved targets.
- prefer minimum-impact proof over full operational abuse.
- avoid persistence unless explicitly approved.
- stop on instability or scope uncertainty.

## Priority Targets
- identity providers and federation trust points.
- domain admin and delegated admin paths.
- privileged service accounts and scheduled task identities.
- systems holding student/parent/staff sensitive data.

## Escalation Workflow
1. Build current access profile and allowed test envelope.
2. Enumerate trust relationships and privilege boundaries.
3. Identify candidate escalation paths by feasibility and blast radius.
4. Validate highest-value paths with controlled proof.
5. Document containment and hardening actions per confirmed path.

## Evidence Standard
Accept a path only when all are present.

- reproducible steps.
- raw proof artifacts (logs, command output, ticket/hash evidence).
- clear privilege delta (before vs after access level).
- impacted systems/data classification.

## AD Attack-Path Checklist
- validate time sync and name resolution first.
- map trust edges and shortest paths to high privilege.
- confirm risky delegations, stale admins, and over-privileged groups.
- test credential abuse only within approved guardrails.

## Windows Escalation Checklist
- enumerate token rights, service misconfigs, weak file/service ACLs.
- inspect scheduled tasks and startup entries writable by low-priv users.
- review local admin sprawl and credential material exposure.
- validate one controlled escalation chain, then stop.

## Linux Escalation Checklist
- enumerate sudo rights, SUID/SGID binaries, capabilities.
- inspect writable scripts executed by privileged contexts.
- review cron/systemd units for unsafe execution paths.
- verify impact with minimal command footprint.

## Risk Ranking Heuristic
Prioritize by:

- `blast_radius`: number of systems/identities reachable.
- `data_sensitivity`: student records, health, discipline, payroll.
- `exploit_reliability`: consistency and operator effort.
- `detection_gap`: likelihood defenders miss activity.

## Required Finding Shape
Use this structure for each confirmed escalation issue.

- `finding_id`
- `initial_context`
- `escalation_path`
- `proof_summary`
- `affected_assets`
- `business_and_privacy_impact`
- `immediate_containment`
- `long_term_fix`

## Guardrails For Tooling
- do not run broad exploit frameworks without a narrowed target list.
- do not reuse credentials/tickets outside approved scenarios.
- do not chain lateral movement automatically.

## Output Contract
Produce these sections before handoff to reporting.

- `validated_attack_paths`
- `rejected_or_unconfirmed_paths`
- `highest_risk_identity_controls`
- `containment_actions_24h`
- `hardening_plan_30_60_90`
