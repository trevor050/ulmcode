# Advanced AD Attacks

Use only after core AD path validation is complete and explicitly authorized.

## Focus Areas
- constrained/unconstrained delegation abuse
- RBCD misconfiguration validation
- AD CS template abuse variants
- trust relationship abuse across domains/forests
- GPO abuse paths with least-impact proof

## Safety Guardrails
- verify rollback and monitoring before each high-impact step
- no persistence or broad automated chaining by default
- capture clear before/after privilege state for each proof

## Output Contract
- `attack_variant`
- `preconditions`
- `proof_steps`
- `privilege_delta`
- `blast_radius`
- `containment_actions`
