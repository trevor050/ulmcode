# K-12 Recon And Infrastructure Testing

## Purpose
Run efficient, low-risk infrastructure assessment across district networks and exposed services.

## Covers
- Planning and sequencing scans for large district environments
- Security scanning and risk-prioritized enumeration
- External exposure checks (internet-facing footprint)
- SSH and SMTP-focused penetration testing workflows
- Wireshark-based packet validation and troubleshooting

## Workflow
1. Establish assessment objectives and safe scan profile.
2. Execute reconnaissance in progressive phases (low-impact first).
3. Validate meaningful findings with protocol-aware checks.
4. Capture packet-level evidence for contentious findings.
5. De-duplicate findings and map to exploitable risk.

## Safety Controls
- Rate limits, concurrency caps, and maintenance window awareness.
- Avoid service-disruptive brute-force behavior during production school hours.
