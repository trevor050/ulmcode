# K-12 Recon And Infrastructure Testing

## Objective
Map district attack surface and validate exploitable infrastructure risk without causing service disruption.

## Recon Principles
- phase from low-impact discovery to targeted validation.
- separate signal from scanner noise before raising findings.
- treat school-hour stability as a hard requirement.
- prefer evidence-backed findings over exhaustive scan volume.

## Phased Workflow
1. Confirm scope, exclusions, maintenance windows, and contact channels.
2. Build baseline inventory (hosts, services, external exposure).
3. Run targeted service checks (SSH, SMTP, web infra, DNS, VPN).
4. Validate high-severity candidates with secondary evidence.
5. Normalize and dedupe results for reporting.

## Safety Controls
- set rate limits and concurrency caps before first scan.
- avoid aggressive flags on production segments during school hours.
- throttle auth testing to prevent lockouts.
- abort on latency spikes or service instability.

## Minimum Data Model
Track each candidate issue with:

- `asset`
- `service_port_protocol`
- `discovery_method`
- `validation_method`
- `risk_hypothesis`
- `evidence_refs`
- `status` (`confirmed` | `rejected` | `needs_followup`)

## External Exposure Checks
Prioritize these first:

- remote access gateways and admin panels.
- mail and DNS infrastructure.
- internet-facing storage, cameras, and management interfaces.
- stale subdomains and abandoned service endpoints.

## SSH Testing Focus
- verify protocol/version hardening.
- check weak auth options and risky ciphers.
- test brute-force resistance within ROE limits.
- confirm privilege boundaries after successful auth.

## SMTP Testing Focus
- verify open relay protection.
- test user enumeration behavior.
- inspect TLS posture and downgrade risk.
- confirm anti-spoofing controls (SPF/DKIM/DMARC presence).

## Packet-Level Validation
Capture packet evidence when scanner output is contested.

- use focused captures tied to test window and host pair.
- annotate capture with hypothesis being validated.
- store raw pcap plus short analyst interpretation.

## False-Positive Control
Require at least one secondary validation for critical/high claims.

- independent tool confirmation, or
- protocol-level manual verification, or
- packet-level proof.

## Output Contract
Produce these sections before report merge.

- `asset_inventory_summary`
- `confirmed_exposures`
- `protocol_specific_findings`
- `rejected_false_positives`
- `residual_risks_and_next_tests`
