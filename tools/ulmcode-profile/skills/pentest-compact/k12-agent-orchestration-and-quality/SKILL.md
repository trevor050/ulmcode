# K-12 Agent Orchestration And Quality

## Purpose
Make multi-agent pentest execution reliable, auditable, and efficient.

## Covers
- Agent role partitioning (recon, privesc, FERPA/risk, reporting)
- Workflow orchestration and dependency management
- Session handoff and continuity controls
- Threat-model-driven test planning
- Agent run quality metrics and regression checks

## Workflow
1. Define per-agent role boundaries and artifacts.
2. Build execution graph with checkpoints and stop gates.
3. Enforce structured handoff format between agents.
4. Evaluate output quality and reliability against acceptance criteria.
5. Feed learnings into next engagement runbook.
