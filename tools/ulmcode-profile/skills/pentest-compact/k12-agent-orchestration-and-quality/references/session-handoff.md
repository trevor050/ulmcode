# Session Handoff

## Objective
Preserve execution context so a fresh agent can resume safely without re-discovery churn.

## Create Workflow
1. Create `handoff.md` in the engagement root.
2. Fill it using `handoff-template.md`.
3. Verify all required fields are concrete (no placeholders).
4. Link supporting artifacts (`finding.md`, `engagement.md`, `agents/*/results.md`, `evidence/*`).

## Resume Workflow
1. Read latest `handoff.md` fully before taking action.
2. Validate scope, authorization status, and unresolved blockers.
3. Confirm referenced files still exist.
4. Start from first open action in `next_actions`.

## Required Handoff Fields
- `scope_status`
- `phase_status`
- `completed_work`
- `open_findings`
- `assumptions_and_risks`
- `blocked_by`
- `next_actions`
- `artifact_index`

## Quality Rules
- Use explicit file paths, not vague descriptions.
- Mark claims as `verified` or `unverified`.
- Keep the next 3 actions concrete and ordered.
- Update handoff when ownership changes.

## Quick Resume Checklist
Use `resume-checklist.md` before resuming destructive or high-impact steps.
