# K-12 Engagement Safety And Change Control

## Purpose
Keep testing legally authorized, operationally safe, and aligned with district continuity requirements.

## Covers
- Scope/ROE parsing and action-level authorization gates
- Non-destructive execution defaults and impact controls
- Destructive testing preconditions, change windows, rollback, and emergency stop

## Workflow
1. Build a scope matrix from authorization docs and SOW.
2. For every action: `ALLOW`, `HOLD`, or `DENY` with explicit rationale.
3. Default to non-destructive mode unless destructive authorization is present.
4. For destructive actions, require: written approval, change window, rollback owner, and monitoring.
5. Log all decisions and safety controls for evidence.

## Hard Rules
- No implied scope.
- No pivoting into discovered assets unless explicitly authorized.
- No disruptive actions outside approved windows.
- Stop immediately on unexpected service impact.
