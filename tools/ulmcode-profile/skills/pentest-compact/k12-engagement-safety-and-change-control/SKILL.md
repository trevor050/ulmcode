# K-12 Engagement Safety And Change Control

## Objective
Keep testing legal, authorized, and operationally safe for district systems.

## Safety Principles
- Default to non-destructive behavior.
- Require explicit authorization at action level, not just project level.
- Protect instruction-critical systems (SIS, LMS, SSO, testing platforms).
- Stop fast on unexpected impact.

## Scope Decision Workflow
1. Parse SOW, ROE, and written approvals into a scope matrix.
2. For each action, label `ALLOW`, `HOLD`, or `DENY`.
3. Record rationale and approver identity for every `ALLOW`.
4. Re-check decision when target, method, or timing changes.

## Scope Matrix Fields
Track these fields for each proposed action.

- `target`
- `method`
- `impact_class` (`low` | `moderate` | `high`)
- `allowed_window`
- `rollback_owner`
- `decision`
- `evidence_ref`

## Non-Destructive Baseline
Use these defaults unless destructive authorization exists.

- throttle scans and login attempts.
- avoid service restarts, config writes, and lockout-prone tests.
- use proof-of-access instead of full exploit chains where possible.
- avoid production-hour high-concurrency traffic.

## Destructive Testing Preconditions
Require all items before any destructive action.

- written approval naming specific targets and methods.
- approved change window with district contact on-call.
- tested rollback plan and owner.
- active monitoring and health checks defined.
- emergency stop command and communication path confirmed.

If any item is missing, do not execute.

## Real-Time Abort Triggers
Stop immediately and notify district contact when any trigger occurs.

- unexpected outage or severe latency.
- authentication failures spiking from test activity.
- unapproved system or subnet touched.
- signs of data integrity risk.

## Evidence Requirements
Record enough detail for post-incident reconstruction.

- timestamped action log.
- pre/post health checks.
- operator identity per action.
- exact command/tool settings used.

## Output Contract
Produce this summary before moving to next phase.

- `scope_matrix`
- `high_impact_actions_attempted`
- `aborts_or_holds`
- `change_control_artifacts`
- `safety_recommendations`
