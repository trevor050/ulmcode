# K-12 Non-Destructive Execution

## Goal
Find real security risk while minimizing impact on instruction, SIS/LMS uptime, testing windows, and parent/student operations.

## Operating Profile
Default to non-destructive mode unless explicit destructive authorization exists.

## Safe Execution Ladder
1. Passive discovery first (inventory, metadata, config review).
2. Low-impact active validation second (rate-limited probes).
3. Controlled proof third (minimal proof without persistence or damage).
4. Stop before disruptive payloads.

## Safety Controls
- Strict rate limits and concurrency caps.
- No brute-force against production identity providers during school hours.
- No malware simulation that can spread or auto-execute.
- No destructive writes, deletes, encryption tests, schema changes, or service restarts.
- Rollback plan required before any state-changing action.

## Verification Standard
A finding is valid only if evidence includes:
- Repro steps
- Affected asset
- Security impact
- Non-destructive proof artifact

## Output Contract
For each test action produce:
- `Intent`
- `Safety Controls Applied`
- `Observed Result`
- `Impact Classification` (None/Low/Medium/High)
