description: Enforces school-district pentest rules of engagement, authorization boundaries, and out-of-scope protections. Use when starting any assessment, reading SOW/authorization docs, planning scans, deciding if an action is permitted, or when scope ambiguity could cause legal or operational risk.

# K-12 ROE Scope Guard

## Purpose
Prevent unauthorized or unsafe actions by forcing explicit scope checks before execution.

## Use This Skill When
- Engagement kickoff or preflight
- New target discovery during testing
- Unsure whether destructive, intrusive, or disruptive actions are authorized
- A request conflicts with written scope, change window, or district policy

## Mandatory Workflow
1. Parse authorization and SOW into a concrete scope table:
   - In-scope assets, out-of-scope assets, allowed techniques, prohibited techniques
   - Time windows, escalation contacts, emergency stop conditions
2. Refuse ambiguous execution:
   - If host/system/account is not explicitly in scope, mark as `HOLD`.
3. Gate each action with a pre-check:
   - `asset in scope?`
   - `technique authorized?`
   - `window active?`
   - `blast radius acceptable?`
4. Log decision rationale per action.
5. If conditions fail, stop and emit a clarification request.

## Hard Rules
- Never assume implied authorization.
- Never pivot from discovered assets without explicit scope inclusion.
- Never run destructive actions outside approved change window.
- For schools, prioritize service continuity over exploit depth.

## Output Contract
Always produce:
- `Scope Matrix`
- `Action Authorization Decision` (`ALLOW`, `HOLD`, `DENY`)
- `Reason + Required Approval`
