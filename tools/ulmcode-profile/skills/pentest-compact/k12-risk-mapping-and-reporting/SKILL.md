# K-12 Risk Mapping And Reporting

## Objective
Translate technical pentest outputs into actionable district risk decisions.

## Reporting Principles
- tie every claim to reproducible evidence.
- express technical impact in student/school operational terms.
- separate confirmed risk from hypothesis.
- prioritize fixes by risk reduction and implementation feasibility.

## Risk Translation Workflow
1. Normalize findings to a consistent quality bar.
2. Map each finding to affected data/process categories.
3. Score severity with district-specific modifiers.
4. Build remediation plan by urgency and dependency.
5. Produce executive and technical outputs from one source of truth.

## K-12 Impact Mapping
For each finding, map impact across:

- `student_data_confidentiality`
- `instructional_continuity`
- `identity_and_access_integrity`
- `financial_or_hr_integrity`
- `district_trust_and_legal_exposure`

## Severity Calibration
Start with technical severity, then adjust with context:

- increase severity if student record exposure is plausible.
- increase severity if exploit path is low-skill/high-reliability.
- increase severity if detection is weak or absent.
- decrease only when compensating controls are verified.

## Evidence Integrity Rules
- preserve original raw artifacts unchanged.
- include timestamps, operator, tool/config context.
- link processed summaries back to raw source files.
- flag unverified claims explicitly.

## Remediation Packaging
For each confirmed finding include:

- `contain_now` (24-72h)
- `stabilize_next` (30 days)
- `structural_fix` (60-90 days)
- `owner_role`
- `success_metric`

## Required Report Sections
- `executive_summary`
- `engagement_scope_and_limits`
- `prioritized_findings_table`
- `ferpa_privacy_impact_analysis`
- `remediation_roadmap_30_60_90`
- `evidence_appendix`

## Quality Gate Before Finalize
Block finalization if any is true:

- finding lacks reproducible evidence.
- severity has no rationale.
- remediation has no owner or timeframe.
- privacy/compliance impact is omitted where relevant.

## PDF Delivery Standard
- ensure table/page breaks keep finding blocks readable.
- ensure evidence references remain intact in PDF.
- run a visual QA pass before final delivery.

## Output Contract
Publish these final artifacts.

- `finding.md`
- `handoff.md`
- `engagement.md`
- `reports/final-report.pdf`
- `reports/quality-checks.json`
