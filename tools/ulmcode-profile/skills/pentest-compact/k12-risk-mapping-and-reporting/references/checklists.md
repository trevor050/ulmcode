# Security Checklists

## OWASP Triage
- verify access control at object and function level
- verify input handling and output encoding
- verify auth/session expiration and revocation behavior
- verify logging for security-critical actions

## Authentication
- MFA enforced for privileged roles
- lockout and rate limits tuned to prevent abuse and DoS
- password reset flow resistant to enumeration
- token lifetimes and rotation rules defined

## API Security
- authz checks are endpoint-specific
- schema validation rejects unknown/unsafe fields
- pagination/filter params cannot bypass scope
- sensitive fields are excluded from default responses

## Data Protection
- encryption at rest and in transit verified
- retention windows are enforced
- backup access controls are audited
- evidence of least-privilege data access exists
