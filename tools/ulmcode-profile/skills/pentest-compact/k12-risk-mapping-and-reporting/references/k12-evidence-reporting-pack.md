# K-12 Evidence Reporting Pack

## Objective
Create reports that are technically rigorous, legally defensible, and understandable by district leadership.

## Evidence Rules
- Timestamp every artifact.
- Record command/tool versions where possible.
- Keep raw evidence immutable.
- Separate observed facts from analyst inference.
- Redact sensitive student/staff data from report exports.

## Required Report Sections
1. Engagement scope and authorization summary
2. Methodology (non-destructive vs destructive profile)
3. Findings by priority
4. Student/privacy impact summary
5. Remediation roadmap (30/60/90 day)
6. Appendix with reproducible evidence trails

## Finding Quality Bar
A finding is publishable only when it includes:
- Asset
- Reproducible steps
- Evidence artifacts
- Risk statement
- Actionable remediation

See `references/finding-template.md` and `references/executive-summary-template.md`.
