# K-12 FERPA Risk Mapper

## Purpose
Translate raw technical findings into decision-ready education risk language.

## Data Sensitivity Model
Classify affected data and systems:
- Student records (PII, grades, disciplinary, health-adjacent records)
- Identity and access systems (SSO, directory, SIS, LMS)
- Staff/parent communications

## Risk Mapping Workflow
1. Identify data touched by vulnerability path.
2. Determine confidentiality/integrity/availability impact.
3. Map to FERPA-relevant exposure posture.
4. Assign severity with exploitability + student impact + operational impact.
5. Recommend remediation with district-safe sequencing.

## Severity Modifiers
Increase severity when:
- Student record access possible at scale
- Cross-school lateral movement possible
- Privilege escalation reaches SIS/LMS admin roles
- Detection/forensics coverage is weak

## Output Contract
Per finding:
- `Technical Summary`
- `Student Data Exposure Potential`
- `FERPA/Privacy Concern Statement`
- `District Impact`
- `Priority + Remediation Plan`
